	<blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1RMT_ld3k">
 	 <p> "If you have just adopted a kitten in to your home or are even just thinking about it, there is a lot you need to know. In this AnimalWised video, we show you everything you need about 'How to CARE for a KITTEN - Food, Education and Health'. By adopting a kitten, we take on the responsibility of looking after all of their basic needs and doing everything we can to help them have a happy and healthy life. This means knowing what their basic needs are and how we can meet them. Their food, hygiene, education, socialization, habits and health are all key areas we need to provide for. A kitten's young age doesn't just make them physically vulnerable, they also need their mental ability to be encouraged.
